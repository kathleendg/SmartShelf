- Expiry Reminder System: The system provides daily summaries of items needing attention (urgent, soon) and sends timely notifications before items expire, configurable by user for daily reminder times and quiet hours.
- Personalized Dashboard: The home screen presents an overview of items, categorized by urgency (Urgent, Use Soon) with a full list of all tracked items, offering quick 'Add Item' access.
- AI Recipe Suggestion Tool: Suggests recipes for expiring items by using a generative AI tool to recommend dishes that utilize the specific item and common pantry ingredients, offering alternative suggestions if desired.
- Item Status Actions: Allows users to mark items as consumed, discarded (with optional reason), or moved to the freezer, which automatically adjusts expiry dates.
- Quick Add & Re-add Options: Facilitates fast entry with pre-defined quick pick chips and a 'Add again' section for recently added items to streamline inventory updates.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #4A9C66. A calm, natural green that evokes freshness, growth, and organized clarity, providing a sense of natural efficiency. It is chosen for its vibrant yet not overpowering presence on a light background.
- Background color: #EAF2EE. A very light, subtle green-tinted white, visibly related in hue to the primary color but heavily desaturated to create a clean, spacious, and inviting canvas.
- Accent color: #BAD837. A bright, energetic lime green chosen for its analogous relationship to the primary hue. Its significantly higher saturation and lightness compared to the primary ensures excellent contrast and makes it suitable for drawing attention to calls-to-action and key notifications, symbolizing vitality and prompt action.
- Headline and Body text font: 'Inter', a clean and highly legible sans-serif font, suitable for both concise headings and comfortable reading in body text. Its modern, neutral design supports an efficient and user-friendly experience.
- Use line-based, minimalistic icons that reflect clarity and simplicity, ensuring they are easily recognizable for categories, storage types, and actions. Icons should have a consistent stroke weight and style.
- Utilize a card-based layout for item displays and informational sections on dashboards. This approach promotes modularity and allows for easy scanning of information. Ample whitespace will ensure a clean, uncluttered interface.
- Incorporate subtle, quick animations for state changes (e.g., item added confirmation, marking as consumed) and smooth transitions between screens to enhance the feeling of responsiveness and fluidity.
